ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Zustik (@DanielZustik on GitHub).

ðŸ‘€ I am actively seeking my first job experience in the tech industry. I'm eager to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting and contribute to meaningful projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying JAVA in college and dedicating time to my personal project, an algorithm visualizer. This project is not only a showcase of my coding skills but also a practical tool for understanding complex algorithms through visual means.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at danielzustik@gmail.com for any inquiries, opportunities, or just to say hello!

âš¡ Fun fact: I've been committed to fitness and have consistently gone to the gym 4 times a week for the past 3 years. I believe in the power of discipline and perseverance, qualities that I bring to my personal and professional life.
